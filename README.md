s3git: git for Cloud Storage<br/>(or Version Control for Data)
==============================================================

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/s3git/s3git](https://badges.gitter.im/s3git/s3git.svg)](https://gitter.im/s3git/s3git?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

s3git applies the git philosophy to Cloud Storage. If you know git, you will know how to use s3git!

s3git is a simple CLI tool that allows you to create a *distributed*, *decentralized* and *versioned* repository. It scales limitlessly to 100s of millions of files and PBs of storage and stores your data safely in S3. Yet huge repos can be cloned on the SSD of your laptop for making local changes, committing and pushing back.

Exactly like git, s3git does not require any server-side components, just download and run the executable. It imports the golang package [s3git-go](https://github.com/s3git/s3git-go) that can be used from other applications as well. Or see the [Python module](https://github.com/s3git/s3git-py) or [Ruby gem](https://github.com/s3git/s3git-rb).

Use cases for s3git
-------------------

- Build and Release Management (see [example](https://github.com/s3git/s3git/blob/master/BINARY-RELEASE-MANAGEMENT.md) with all Kubernetes releases).
- DevOps Scenarios
- Data Consolidation
- Analytics
- Photo and Video storage

See [use cases](https://github.com/s3git/s3git/blob/master/USECASES.md) for a detailed description of these use cases.

```
C:\Users\Username\Downloads> s3git.exe
```

Building from source
--------------------

Build instructions are as follows (see [install golang](https://docs.minio.io/docs/how-to-install-golang) for setting up a working golang environment):

```sh
$ go get -d github.com/s3git/s3git
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/s3git/s3git 
$ go install
$ s3git
```

BLAKE2 Tree Hashing and Storage Format
--------------------------------------

Read [here](https://github.com/s3git/s3git/blob/master/BLAKE2.md) how s3git uses the BLAKE2 Tree hashing mode for both [deduplicated](https://github.com/s3git/s3git/blob/master/BLAKE2.md#deduplicated) and [hydrated](https://github.com/s3git/s3git/blob/master/BLAKE2.md#hydrated) storage (and [here](https://github.com/s3git/s3git/blob/master/BLAKE2-and-Scalability.md) for info for BLAKE2 at scale).

Example workflow
----------------

Here is a simple workflow to create a new repository and populate it with some data:
```sh
$ mkdir s3git-repo && cd s3git-repo
$ s3git init
Initialized empty s3git repository in ...
$ # Just stream in some text
$ echo "hello s3git" | s3git add
Added: 18e622875a89cede0d7019b2c8afecf8928c21eac18ec51e38a8e6b829b82c3ef306dec34227929fa77b1c7c329b3d4e50ed9e72dc4dc885be0932d3f28d7053
$ # Add some more files
$ s3git add "*.mp4"
$ # Commit and log
$ s3git commit -m "My first commit"
$ s3git log --pretty
```

Push to cloud storage
---------------------

```sh
$ # Add remote back end and push to it
$ s3git remote add "primary" -r s3://s3git-playground -a "AKIAJYNT4FCBFWDQPERQ" -s "OVcWH7ZREUGhZJJAqMq4GVaKDKGW6XyKl80qYvkW"
$ s3git push
$ # Read back content
$ s3git cat 18e6
hello s3git
```

_Note: Do not store any important info in the s3git-playground bucket. It will be auto-deleted within 24-hours._
 
Directory versioning
--------------------

You can also use s3git for directory versioning. This allows you to 'capture' changes coherently all the way down from a directory and subsequently go back to previous versions of the *full state of the directory* (and not just any file). Think of it as a Time Machine for directories instead of individual files.

So instead of 'saving' a directory by making a full copy into 'MyFolder-v2' (and 'MyFolder-v3', etc.) you capture the state of a directory and give it a meaningful message ("Changed color to red") as version so it is always easy to go back to the version you are looking for.

In addition you can discard any uncommitted changes that you made and go back to the last version that you have captured, which basically means you can (after committing) mess around in a directory and then be rest assured that you can always go back to its original state.

If you push your repository into the cloud then you will have an automatic backup and additionally you can easily collaborate with other people.

Lastly, it works of course with huge binary data too, so not just for text files as in the following 'demo' example:

```sh
$ mkdir dir-versioning && cd dir-versioning
$ s3git init .
$ # Just create a single file
$ echo "First line" > text.txt && ls -l
-rw-rw-r-- 1 ec2-user ec2-user 11 May 25 09:06 text.txt
$ #
$ # Create initial snapshot
$ s3git snapshot create -m "Initial snapshot" .
$ # Add new line to initial file and create another file
$ echo "Second line" >> text.txt && echo "Another file" > text2.txt && ls -l
-rw-rw-r-- 1 ec2-user ec2-user 23 May 25 09:08 text.txt
-rw-rw-r-- 1 ec2-user ec2-user 13 May 25 09:08 text2.txt
$ s3git snapshot status .
     New: /home/ec2-user/dir-versioning/text2.txt
Modified: /home/ec2-user/dir-versioning/text.txt
$ #
$ # Create second snapshot
$ s3git snapshot create -m "Second snapshot" .
$ s3git log --pretty
3a4c3466264904fed3d52a1744fb1865b21beae1a79e374660aa231e889de41191009afb4795b61fdba9c156 Second snapshot
77a8e169853a7480c9a738c293478c9923532f56fcd02e3276142a1a29ac7f0006b5dff65d5ca245255f09fa Initial snapshot
$ more text.txt
First line
Second line
$ more text2.txt
Another file
$ #
$ # Go back one version in time
$ s3git snapshot checkout . HEAD^
$ more text.txt
First line
$ more text2.txt
text2.txt: No such file or directory
$ #
$ # Switch back to latest revision
$ s3git snapshot checkout .
$ more text2.txt
Another file
```

Note that snapshotting works for all files in the directory including any subdirectories. Click the following link for a more elaborate repository that includes all releases of the [Kubernetes](https://github.com/s3git/s3git/blob/master/BINARY-RELEASE-MANAGEMENT.md) project.

Clone the YFCC100M dataset
--------------------------

Clone a large repo with 100 million files totaling 11.5 TB in size ([Multimedia Commons](http://aws.amazon.com/public-data-sets/multimedia-commons/)), yet requiring only 7 GB local disk space.

_(Note that this takes about **7 minutes** on an SSD-equipped MacBook Pro with 500 Mbit/s download connection so for less powerful hardware you may want to skip to the next section (or if you lack 7 GB local disk space, try a `df -h .` first). Then again it is quite a few files...)_

```sh
$ s3git clone s3://s3git-100m -a "AKIAI26TSIF6JIMMDSPQ" -s "5NvshAhI0KMz5Gbqkp7WNqXYlnjBjkf9IaJD75x7"
Cloning into ...
Done. Totaling 97,974,749 objects.
$ cd s3git-100m
$ # List all files starting with '123456'

Fork that repo
--------------

Below is an example for `alice` and `bob` working together on a repository.

```sh
$ mkdir alice && cd alice
alice $ s3git clone s3://s3git-spoon-knife -a "AKIAJYNT4FCBFWDQPERQ" -s "OVcWH7ZREUGhZJJAqMq4GVaKDKGW6XyKl80qYvkW"
Cloning into .../alice/s3git-spoon-knife
Done. Totaling 0 objects.
alice $ cd s3git-spoon-knife
alice $ # add a file filled with zeros
alice $ dd if=/dev/zero count=1 | s3git add
Added: 3ad6df690177a56092cb1ac7e9690dcabcac23cf10fee594030c7075ccd9c5e38adbaf58103cf573b156d114452b94aa79b980d9413331e22a8c95aa6fb60f4e

Clone it again as `bob` on a different computer/different directory/different universe:
 
```sh
$ mkdir bob && cd bob
bob $ s3git clone s3://s3git-spoon-knife -a "AKIAJYNT4FCBFWDQPERQ" -s "OVcWH7ZREUGhZJJAqMq4GVaKDKGW6XyKl80qYvkW"
Cloning into .../bob/s3git-spoon-knife
Done. Totaling 10 objects.
bob $ cd s3git-spoon-knife
bob $ # Check if we can access our empty file
bob $ s3git cat 3ad6 | hexdump

Integration with Minio
----------------------

Instead of S3 you can happily use the [Minio](https://github.com/minio/minio) server, for example the public server at https://play.minio.io:9000. Just make sure you have a bucket created using [mc](https://github.com/minio/mc) (example below uses `s3git-test`):

```sh
$ mkdir minio-test && cd minio-test
$ s3git init 
$ s3git remote add "primary" -r s3://s3git-test -a "Q3AM3UQ867SPQQA43P2F" -s "zuf+tfteSlswRu7BJ86wekitnifILbZam1KYY3TG" -e "https://play.minio.io:9000"
$ echo "hello minio" | s3git add
Added: c7bb516db796df8dcc824aec05db911031ab3ac1e5ff847838065eeeb52d4410b4d57f8df2e55d14af0b7b1d28362de1176cd51892d7cbcaaefb2cd3f616342f
$ s3git commit -m "Commit for minio test"
$ s3git push
Pushing 1 / 1 [==============================================================================================================================] 100.00 % 0

and clone it 

```sh

FAQ
---

**Q** Is s3git compatible to git at the binary level?  
**A** No. git is optimized for text content with very nice and powerful diffing and using compressed storage whereas s3git is more focused on large repos with primarily non-text blobs backed up by cloud storage like S3.  
**Q** Do you support encryption?  
**A** No. However it is trivial to encrypt data before streaming into `s3git add`, eg pipe it through `openssl enc` or similar.  
**Q** Do you support zipping?  
**A** No. Again it is trivial to zip it before streaming into `s3git add`, eg pipe it through `zip -r - .` or similar.  
**Q** Why don't you provide a FUSE interface?  
**A** Supporting FUSE would mean introducing a lot of complexity related to POSIX which we would rather avoid.
